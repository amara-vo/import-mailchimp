# import-mailchimp
Import MailChimp data into Google Sheets. This program gets the most recently uploaded CSV file in a specified Google folder, and then adds it to a specified Google spreadsheet. A separate Google form was created in order to make it easier for users to upload CSV data without worrying about the backend.

Developed for RelishCareers in Summer 2020 in order to collect MailChimp data more efficiently.
